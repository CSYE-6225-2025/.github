*   RESTful Application Development & Enhanced CI:
    
    *   Developed a scalable RESTful application, with Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions ensuring code reliability and quality.
        
    *   Integrated detailed logging and metrics for effective monitoring and performance analysis.
        
*   Application Scaling and Event-Driven Architecture:
    
    *   Implemented AutoScaling for dynamic capacity management.
        
    *   Used Amazon SNS for an efficient, event-driven architecture.
        
*   AMI Creation and Userdata Scripting:
    
    *   Customized Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for a consistent deployment environment.
        
    *   Leveraged userdata scripts for automated instance configuration.
        
*   Robust Infrastructure Deployment with Security:
    
    *   Deployed a secure AWS infrastructure, with a focus on network and resource isolation.
        
    *   Utilized IAM roles and security groups to enforce strict access controls and security best practices.
        
    *   Configured the Application Load Balancer to only accept HTTPS requests, enhancing data security in transit, with SSL/TLS certificates managed through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
        
    *   Employed Route 53 for reliable domain registration and DNS management.
